# Hi, I'm Aleksandra 👋

## About Me

I'm a **Bioinformatics student** at Jagiellonian University with a strong interest in **Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity**. I enjoy solving problems through code—whether it's building C++ algorithms, training ML models, or analysing and securing data.

🎯 **Currently seeking internships** in: Software Engineering, Data Science / ML, Cybersecurity  
📍 Based in Poland | 🌍 Open to remote & hybrid opportunities

## What I'm Working On

- 🧬 **CAMDA 2025 Challenge** – ML models predicting bacterial antibiotic resistance from genomic data (Python, scikit-learn, pandas)
- 🎵 **Rudiments Buddy** – Percussion practice analyzer with beat detection and timing precision grading (Python, librosa, tkinter)
- 🗂️ **Emergency Station Database** – SQL Server database with Python GUI and synthetic data generation (Python, SQL, Faker)
- 🌳 **KD-Tree Implementation** – Custom C++ nearest-neighbor search with benchmarking vs naive approach (C++17, STL, tests)

## Tech Stack & Focus Areas

### 💻 Software Engineering
- **Languages**: C++ (OOP, STL, algorithms), Python (OOP, scripting, GUI)
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, CMake, GTest, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Sample projects**: [KD-tree](https://github.com/Rac00nCanFly/CPP_KDTree-with-KNN), [Task Manager](https://github.com/Rac00nCanFly/Task-manager-python/tree/main), [Rudiments Buddy](https://github.com/Rac00nCanFly/rudiments-buddy)

### 📊 Data & Machine Learning
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib), SQL (T-SQL)
- **Experience**:
  - Regression models (Lasso, Ridge) and model evaluation
  - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization
- **Sample projects**: [Opossum Age Prediction](https://github.com/Rac00nCanFly/Machine-Learning),[Emergency Station DB](https://github.com/Rac00nCanFly/Emergency-Station-Database)

### 🔐 Cybersecurity & Secure Data
- **Interests**: cybersecurity fundamentals, OWASP Top 10, secure coding, access control, data quality and governance
- **Practice so far**:
  - Working with real data pipelines during a Data Governance / Data Science internship
  - Using Python/SQL to validate and check data consistency
  - Focusing on clear, testable code and understanding of how data is stored, accessed, and audited
- **Goal**: grow into roles like **Cyber Security Analyst / Cloud Cybersecurity Engineer Intern** combining data skills with security awareness

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

I actively use AI tools (e.g. GitHub Copilot / LLMs) to:
- generate initial boilerplate and refactoring suggestions,
- explore alternative implementations,
- draft tests and documentation.

All generated code is **reviewed, adapted, and tested manually** before use.
